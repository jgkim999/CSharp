# Application Layer

The Application layer is responsible for coordinating the interactions between the Domain layer and the Infrastructure layer.  
It contains the use cases and application services that define the high-level behavior of the system.  

The Application layer should not contain any business logic.  
Instead, it should delegate to the Domain layer to perform the necessary operations.  

The Application layer should also define the interfaces for any external dependencies that the system needs to interact with.
