# Infrastructure Layer

The Infrastructure layer is responsible for providing the implementation details for the interfaces defined in the Domain and Application layers.  
It contains the code that interacts with external dependencies such as databases, file systems, and external APIs.

The Infrastructure layer should be designed to be easily replaceable.  
This means that the code should be decoupled from any specific implementation details, such as the choice of database or web framework.
