# Domain Layer

The Domain layer is the core of the application.  
It contains the business logic and rules that define the behavior of the system.  
This layer should be independent of any external dependencies and frameworks.  
It should only contain pure business logic and data structures.  

The Domain layer should define the entities, value objects, and domain services that represent the core concepts of the application.  
It should also define the interfaces for any external dependencies that the application needs to interact with, such as databases or external APIs.
