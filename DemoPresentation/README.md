# Presentation Layer

The Presentation layer is responsible for handling the user interface and user input.  
It contains the code that handles HTTP requests, renders HTML templates, and interacts with JavaScript on the client side.

The Presentation layer should be designed to be easily replaceable.  
This means that the code should be decoupled from any specific web framework or front-end library.
